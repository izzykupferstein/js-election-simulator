## Project overview
The goal of this project is to build and test mass voting systems in Javascript. In the running instance, a test is run which will build a random number of voters who vote for a number of parties. The application can run assessments on the data and return a candidate with the most votes, or alternatively all tied candidates.

Application may be run at https://izzykupferstein.github.io/js-election-simulator/. There will be a 2+ second delay as data is being generated. See console for logged output.
